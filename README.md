# Blazor Components

This project was created to help me learn and remember displaying an image in a Blazor Application.

## Why

I wanted to be able to display an image file within a Blazor page.  During my research I realized that there is very little difference between displaying an image in Blazor as compared to displaying it in a HTML page.  So, I decided to add a couple of other features to my application.

I will be using the Blazor Server configuration for this application.  We can do this with the Client-side configuration, but you need an API to access the server files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorDisplayImages
   cd BlazorDisplayImages
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

Get a list of files on the server 

Display at list in a Blazor page 

Provide a UI effect to zoom in on the image
